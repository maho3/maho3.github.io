abstract: 'This paper presents the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference
  (LtU-ILI) pipeline, a codebase for rapid, user-friendly, and cutting-edge machine
  learning (ML) inference in astrophysics and cosmology. The pipeline includes software
  for implementing various neural architectures, training schema, priors, and density
  estimators in a manner easily adaptable to any research workflow. It includes comprehensive
  validation metrics to assess posterior estimate coverage, enhancing the reliability
  of inferred results. Additionally, the pipeline is easily parallelizable, designed
  for efficient exploration of modeling hyperparameters. To demonstrate its capabilities,
  we present real applications across a range of astrophysics and cosmology problems,
  such as: estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray photometry; inferring cosmology
  from matter power spectra and halo point clouds; characterising progenitors in gravitational
  wave signals; capturing physical dust parameters from galaxy colors and luminosities;
  and establishing properties of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We also
  include exhaustive benchmarking and comparisons of all implemented methods as well
  as discussions about the challenges and pitfalls of ML inference in astronomical
  sciences. All code and examples are made publicly available at https://github.com/maho3/ltu-ili.'
