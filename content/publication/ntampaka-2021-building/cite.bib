 abstract = {Astronomy is entering an era of data-driven discovery, due in part to modern machine learning (ML) techniques enabling powerful new ways to interpret observations. This shift in our scientific approach requires us to consider whether we can trust the black box. Here, we overview methods for an often-overlooked step in the development of ML models: building community trust in the algorithms. Trust is an essential ingredient not just for creating more robust data analysis techniques, but also for building confidence within the astronomy community to embrace machine learning methods and results.},
