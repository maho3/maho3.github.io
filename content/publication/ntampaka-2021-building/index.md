abstract: 'Astronomy is entering an era of data-driven discovery, due in part to modern
  machine learning (ML) techniques enabling powerful new ways to interpret observations.
  This shift in our scientific approach requires us to consider whether we can trust
  the black box. Here, we overview methods for an often-overlooked step in the development
  of ML models: building community trust in the algorithms. Trust is an essential
  ingredient not just for creating more robust data analysis techniques, but also
  for building confidence within the astronomy community to embrace machine learning
  methods and results.'
