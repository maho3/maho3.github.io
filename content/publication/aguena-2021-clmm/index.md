abstract: We present the v1.0 release of CLMM, an open source PYTHON library for the
  estimation of the weak lensing masses of clusters of galaxies. CLMM is designed
  as a stand-alone toolkit of building blocks to enable end-to-end analysis pipeline
  validation for upcoming cluster cosmology analyses such as the ones that will be
  performed by the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time-Dark Energy Science
  Collaboration (LSST-DESC). Its purpose is to serve as a flexible, easy-to-install,
  and easy-to-use interface for both weak lensing simulators and observers and can
  be applied to real and mock data to study the systematics affecting weak lensing
  mass reconstruction. At the core of CLMM are routines to model the weak lensing
  shear signal given the underlying mass distribution of galaxy clusters and a set
  of data operations to prepare the corresponding data vectors. The theoretical predictions
  rely on existing software, used as backends in the code, that have been thoroughly
  tested and cross-checked. Combined theoretical predictions and data can be used
  to constrain the mass distribution of galaxy clusters as demonstrated in a suite
  of example Jupyter Notebooks shipped with the software and also available in the
  extensive online documentation.
