abstract: Machine learning has rapidly become a tool of choice for the astronomical
  community. It is being applied across a wide range of wavelengths and problems,
  from the classification of transients to neural network emulators of cosmological
  simulations, and is shifting paradigms about how we generate and report scientific
  results. At the same time, this class of method comes with its own set of best practices,
  challenges, and drawbacks, which, at present, are often reported on incompletely
  in the astrophysical literature. With this paper, we aim to provide a primer to
  the astronomical community, including authors, reviewers, and editors, on how to
  implement machine learning models and report their results in a way that ensures
  the accuracy of the results, reproducibility of the findings, and usefulness of
  the method.
