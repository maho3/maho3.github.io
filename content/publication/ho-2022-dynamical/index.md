abstract: In 1933, Fritz Zwicky's famous investigations of the mass of the Coma cluster
  led him to infer the existence of dark matter<SUP>1</SUP>. His fundamental discoveries
  have proven to be foundational to modern cosmology; as we now know, such dark matter
  makes up 85% of the matter and 25% of the mass-energy content in the universe. Galaxy
  clusters like Coma are massive, complex systems of dark matter, hot ionized gas
  and thousands of galaxies, and serve as excellent probes of the dark matter distribution.
  However, empirical studies show that the total mass of such systems remains elusive
  and difficult to precisely constrain. Here we present new estimates for the dynamical
  mass of the Coma cluster based on Bayesian deep learning methodologies developed
  in recent years. Using our novel data-driven approach, we predict Coma's M<SUB>200c</SUB>
  mass to be 10<SUP>15.10±0.15</SUP> h<SUP>−1</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within a radius
  of 1.78 ± 0.03 h<SUP>−1</SUP> Mpc of its centre. We show that our predictions are
  rigorous across multiple training datasets and statistically consistent with historical
  estimates of Coma's mass. This measurement reinforces our understanding of the dynamical
  state of the Coma cluster and advances rigorous analyses and verification methods
  for empirical applications of machine learning in astronomy.
