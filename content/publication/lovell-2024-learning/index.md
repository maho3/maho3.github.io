abstract: 'We perform the first direct cosmological and astrophysical parameter inference
  from the combination of galaxy luminosity functions and colours using a simulation
  based inference approach. Using the Synthesizer code we simulate the dust attenuated
  ultraviolet--near infrared stellar emission from galaxies in thousands of cosmological
  hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS suite, including the Swift-EAGLE, Illustris-TNG,
  Simba &amp; Astrid galaxy formation models. For each galaxy we calculate the rest-frame
  luminosity in a number of photometric bands, including the SDSS $textitugriz$ and
  GALEX FUV &amp; NUV filters; this dataset represents the largest catalogue of synthetic
  photometry based on hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations produced to date,
  totalling &gt;200 million sources. From these we compile luminosity functions and
  colour distributions, and find clear dependencies on both cosmology and feedback.
  We then perform simulation based (likelihood-free) inference using these distributions,
  and obtain constraints on both cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Both colour
  distributions and luminosity functions provide complementary information on certain
  parameters when performing inference. Most interestingly we achieve constraints
  on $σ_8$, describing the clustering of matter. This is attributable to the fact
  that the photometry encodes the star formation--metal enrichment history of each
  galaxy; galaxies in a universe with a higher $σ_8$ tend to form earlier and have
  higher metallicities, which leads to redder colours. We find that a model trained
  on one galaxy formation simulation generalises poorly when applied to another, and
  attribute this to differences in the subgrid prescriptions, and lack of flexibility
  in our emission modelling. The photometric catalogues are publicly available at:
  https://camels.readthedocs.io/ .'
