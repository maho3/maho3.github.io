 abstract = {Understanding the impact of dust on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is crucial for inferring their physical properties and for studying the nature of interstellar dust. We analyze dust attenuation curves for $∼ 6400$ galaxies ($M_⋆ ∼ 10^9 - 10^11.5\,M_ødot$) at $z=0.07$ in the IllustrisTNG50 and TNG100 simulations. Using radiative transfer post-processing, we generate synthetic attenuation curves and fit them with a parametric model that captures known extinction and attenuation laws (e.g., Calzetti, MW, SMC, LMC) and more exotic forms. We present the distributions of the best-fitting parameters: UV slope ($c_1$), optical-to-NIR slope ($c_2$), FUV slope ($c_3$), 2175 Angstrom bump strength ($c_4$), and normalization ($A_m̊ V$). Key correlations emerge between $A_\ ̊V$ and the star formation rate surface density $Σ_\rS̊FR$, as well as the UV slope $c_1$. The UV and FUV slopes ($c_1, c_3$) and the bump strength and visual attenuation ($c_4, A_\rm̊$) exhibit robust internal correlations. Using these insights from simulations, we provide a set of scaling relations that predict a galaxy's median (averaged over line of sight) dust attenuation curve based solely on its $Σ_\rm R̊$ and/or $A_\rm V.̊ These predictions agree well with observed attenuation curves from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog despite minor differences in bump strength. This study delivers the most comprehensive library of synthetic attenuation curves for local galaxies, providing a foundation for physically motivated priors in SED fitting and galaxy inference studies, such as those performed as part of the Learning the Universe Collaboration.},
