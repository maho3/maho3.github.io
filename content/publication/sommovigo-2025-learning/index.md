abstract: "Understanding the impact of dust on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
  of galaxies is crucial for inferring their physical properties and for studying
  the nature of interstellar dust. We analyze dust attenuation curves for $∼ 6400$
  galaxies ($M_⋆ ∼ 10^9 - 10^11.5,M_ødot$) at $z=0.07$ in the IllustrisTNG50 and TNG100
  simulations. Using radiative transfer post-processing, we generate synthetic attenuation
  curves and fit them with a parametric model that captures known extinction and attenuation
  laws (e.g., Calzetti, MW, SMC, LMC) and more exotic forms. We present the distributions
  of the best-fitting parameters: UV slope ($c_1$), optical-to-NIR slope ($c_2$),
  FUV slope ($c_3$), 2175 Angstrom bump strength ($c_4$), and normalization ($A_m̊
  V$). Key correlations emerge between $A_ ̊V$ and the star formation rate surface
  density $Σ_rS̊FR$, as well as the UV slope $c_1$. The UV and FUV slopes ($c_1, c_3$)
  and the bump strength and visual attenuation ($c_4, A_rm̊$) exhibit robust internal
  correlations. Using these insights from simulations, we provide a set of scaling
  relations that predict a galaxy's median (averaged over line of sight) dust attenuation
  curve based solely on its $Σ_rm R̊$ and/or $A_rm V.̊ These predictions agree well
  with observed attenuation curves from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog despite
  minor differences in bump strength. This study delivers the most comprehensive library
  of synthetic attenuation curves for local galaxies, providing a foundation for physically
  motivated priors in SED fitting and galaxy inference studies, such as those performed
  as part of the Learning the Universe Collaboration."
