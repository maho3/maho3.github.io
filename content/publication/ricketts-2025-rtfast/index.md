abstract: 'Bayesian analysis has begun to be more widely adopted in X-ray spectroscopy,
  but it has largely been constrained to relatively simple physical models due to
  limitations in X-ray modelling software and computation time. As a result, Bayesian
  analysis of numerical models with high physics complexity have remained out of reach.
  This is a challenge, for example when modelling the X-ray emission of accreting
  black hole X-ray binaries, where the slow model computations severely limit explorations
  of parameter space and may bias the inference of astrophysical parameters. Here,
  we present RTFAST-Spectra: a neural network emulator that acts as a drop in replacement
  for the spectral portion of the black hole X-ray reverberation model RTDIST. This
  is the first emulator for the reltrans model suite and the first emulator for a
  state-of-the-art X-ray reflection model incorporating relativistic effects with
  17 physically meaningful model parameters. We use principal component analysis to
  create a light-weight neural network that is able to preserve correlations between
  complex atomic lines and simple continuum, enabling consistent modelling of key
  parameters of scientific interest. We achieve a <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"TM0001\"
  notation=\"LaTeX\">$mathcal O(10^2)$</tex-math></inline-formula> times speed up
  over the original model in the most conservative conditions with <inline-formula><tex-math
  id=\"TM0002\" notation=\"LaTeX\">$mathcal O(1~ mÌŠ per cent)$</tex-math></inline-formula>
  precision over all 17 free parameters in the original numerical model, taking full
  posterior fits from months to hours. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling
  to show how we can better explore the posteriors of model parameters in simulated
  data and discuss the complexities in interpreting the model when fitting real data.'
