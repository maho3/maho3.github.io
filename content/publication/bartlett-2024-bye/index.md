abstract: Bias models relating the dark matter field to the spatial distribution of
  halos are widely used in current cosmological analyses. Many models predict halos
  purely from the local Eulerian matter density, yet bias models in perturbation theory
  require other local properties. We assess the validity of assuming that only the
  local dark matter density can be used to predict the number density of halos in
  a model-independent way and in the nonperturbative regime. Utilizing N-body simulations,
  we study the properties of the halo counts field after spatial voxels with near-equal
  dark matter density have been permuted. If local-in-matter-density (LIMD) biasing
  were valid, the statistical properties of the permuted and unpermuted fields would
  be indistinguishable since both represent equally fair draws of the stochastic biasing
  model. If the Lagrangian radius is greater than approximately half the voxel size
  and for halos less massive than ∼10<SUP>15</SUP> h<SUP>‑1</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>, we
  find the permuted halo field has a scale-dependent bias with greater than 25% more
  power on scales relevant for current surveys. These bias models remove small-scale
  power by not modeling correlations between neighboring voxels, which substantially
  boosts large-scale power to conserve the field's total variance. This conclusion
  is robust to the choice of initial conditions and cosmology. Assuming LIMD halo
  biasing cannot, therefore, reproduce the distribution of halos across a large range
  of scales and halo masses, no matter how complex the model. One must either allow
  the biasing to be a function of other quantities and/or remove the assumption that
  neighboring voxels are statistically independent.
