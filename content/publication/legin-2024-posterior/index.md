abstract: Reconstructing the initial conditions of the universe is a key problem in
  cosmology. Methods based on simulating the forward evolution of the universe have
  provided a way to infer initial conditions consistent with present-day observations.
  However, due to the high complexity of the inference problem, these methods either
  fail to sample a distribution of possible initial density fields or require significant
  approximations in the simulation model to be tractable, potentially leading to biased
  results. In this work, we propose the use of score-based generative models to sample
  realizations of the early universe given present-day observations. We infer the
  initial density field of full high-resolution dark matter N-body simulations from
  the present-day density field and verify the quality of produced samples compared
  to the ground truth based on summary statistics. The proposed method is capable
  of providing plausible realizations of the early universe density field from the
  initial conditions posterior distribution marginalized over cosmological parameters
  and can sample orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art methods.
