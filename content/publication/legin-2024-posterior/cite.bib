 abstract = {Reconstructing the initial conditions of the universe is a key problem in cosmology. Methods based on simulating the forward evolution of the universe have provided a way to infer initial conditions consistent with present-day observations. However, due to the high complexity of the inference problem, these methods either fail to sample a distribution of possible initial density fields or require significant approximations in the simulation model to be tractable, potentially leading to biased results. In this work, we propose the use of score-based generative models to sample realizations of the early universe given present-day observations. We infer the initial density field of full high-resolution dark matter N-body simulations from the present-day density field and verify the quality of produced samples compared to the ground truth based on summary statistics. The proposed method is capable of providing plausible realizations of the early universe density field from the initial conditions posterior distribution marginalized over cosmological parameters and can sample orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art methods.},
