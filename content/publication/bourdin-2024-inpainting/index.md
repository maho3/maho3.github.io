abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, while the current state-of-the
  art methodology for generating theoretical predictions for the large scale structures
  of the Universe, are among the most expensive simulation tools, requiring upwards
  of 100 millions CPU hours per simulation. N-body simulations, which exclusively
  model dark matter and its purely gravitational interactions, represent a less resource-intensive
  alternative, however, they do not model galaxies, and as such cannot directly be
  compared to observations. In this study, we use conditional score-based models to
  learn a mapping from N-body to hydrodynamical simulations, specifically from dark
  matter density fields to the observable distribution of galaxies. We demonstrate
  that our model is capable of generating galaxy fields statistically consistent with
  hydrodynamical simulations at a fraction of the computational cost, and demonstrate
  our emulator is significantly more precise than traditional emulators over the scales
  0.36 $h textMpc^-1$ $łeq$ k $łeq$ 3.88 $h textMpc^-1$.
