abstract: We study methods for reconstructing Bayesian uncertainties on dynamical
  mass estimates of galaxy clusters using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We
  discuss the statistical background of approximate Bayesian neural networks and demonstrate
  how variational inference techniques can be used to perform computationally tractable
  posterior estimation for a variety of deep neural architectures. We explore how
  various model designs and statistical assumptions impact prediction accuracy and
  uncertainty reconstruction in the context of cluster mass estimation. We measure
  the quality of our model posterior recovery using a mock cluster observation catalog
  derived from the MultiDark simulation and UniverseMachine catalog. We show that
  approximate Bayesian CNNs produce highly accurate dynamical cluster mass posteriors.
  These model posteriors are log-normal in cluster mass and recover 68% and 90% confidence
  intervals to within 1% of their measured value. We note how this rigorous modeling
  of dynamical mass posteriors is necessary for using cluster abundance measurements
  to constrain cosmological parameters.
