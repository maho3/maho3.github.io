      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University, exploring the intersection of **artificial intelligence, astrophysics, and cosmology**. 
I build machine learning models that analyze a mix of **observational and simulated data** for inference and emulation. My research addresses a broad spectrum of problems, including cosmological galaxy clustering, galaxy formation, galaxy clusters, and dust attenuation.
My research focuses on robust and reliable ML for science, using **Bayesian statistics** and **explainable AI** to build trust in complex models.
I co-lead the Implicit Likelihood Inference group within the [Learning the Universe collaboration](https://learning-the-universe.org/).

My publications are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TJBifHwAAAAJ&hl=en) and my open-source projects are on [GitHub](https://github.com/maho3). I'm always looking for new collaborators, so please feel free to [send me an email](mailto:matthew.annam.ho@gmail.com)!
